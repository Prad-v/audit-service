# Outage Monitoring Limitations

## Overview

The multi-cloud outage monitoring system provides real-time monitoring of cloud provider status pages, RSS feeds, and APIs. However, there are some limitations due to how different cloud providers expose their incident data.

## Provider Status

### ✅ Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Status**: Fully Supported
- **Data Source**: 
  - RSS Feed (`https://status.cloud.google.com/en/feed.atom`)
  - **JSON API** (`https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents.json`) - **COMPREHENSIVE DATA**
- **Historical Data**: Available through JSON API (78+ incidents)
- **Limitations**: None

### ⚠️ Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Status**: Limited Support
- **Data Source**: RSS Feed (`https://status.aws.amazon.com/rss/all.rss`) - **DEPRECATED**
- **Historical Data**: Limited - RSS feeds are no longer updated
- **Current Incidents**: Available on [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status)
- **Limitations**: 
  - RSS feeds are deprecated and no longer populated
  - Real-time data requires AWS Health API with authentication
  - Public RSS feeds show 0 incidents even when incidents exist

### ⚠️ Microsoft Azure
- **Status**: Limited Support
- **Data Source**: RSS Feed (`https://status.azure.com/en-us/status/feed/`)
- **Historical Data**: Limited - RSS feed may be empty
- **Current Incidents**: Available on [Azure Status Page](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status/)
- **Limitations**: 
  - RSS feed may not contain all incidents
  - Some incidents may only appear on the web interface

### ❌ Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- **Status**: Not Supported
- **Data Source**: None available
- **Historical Data**: Not available
- **Limitations**: 
  - No public RSS feed provided
  - No public API for incident data
  - Incidents are only visible through the OCI console

## Why Limited Data?

### 1. **AWS Migration to Health Dashboard**
AWS has moved their incident reporting from RSS feeds to the AWS Health Dashboard. The old RSS feeds (`https://status.aws.amazon.com/rss/*`) are no longer updated, which is why they show 0 incidents even when incidents exist on the [Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status).

### 2. **Provider Policies**
Different cloud providers have different policies for exposing incident data:
- **GCP**: Provides comprehensive RSS feeds with historical data
- **AWS**: Requires authentication for real-time data access
- **Azure**: Limited RSS feed data
- **OCI**: No public data exposure

### 3. **Data Source Limitations**
Different data sources have different limitations:

**RSS Feeds** typically only contain recent incidents and may not include:
- Historical incidents older than a few days
- Maintenance notifications
- Planned outages
- Service-specific incidents

**JSON APIs** (like GCP's incidents.json) provide:
- Comprehensive historical data
- Detailed incident information
- Better structured data
- More reliable parsing

## Solutions and Workarounds

### For AWS Data
To get real-time AWS incident data, you would need to:

1. **Use AWS Health API** (requires AWS credentials):
   ```bash
   aws health describe-events --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Set up AWS Health API integration**:
   - Configure AWS credentials
   - Use the AWS Health API client
   - Parse the JSON responses

3. **Manual monitoring**:
   - Check the [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status) manually
   - Set up notifications through AWS SNS

### For Azure Data
To get more comprehensive Azure data:

1. **Use Azure Status API** (if available)
2. **Monitor the web interface** for real-time updates
3. **Set up Azure Monitor alerts**

### For OCI Data
OCI does not provide public APIs for incident data. You would need to:

1. **Use OCI Console** for manual monitoring
2. **Set up OCI Notifications** (requires OCI account)
3. **Monitor OCI documentation** for announcements

## Current System Behavior

The outage monitoring system correctly:

1. **Detects when RSS feeds are empty** and logs appropriate messages
2. **Provides clear feedback** about why data is limited
3. **Continues to monitor** available sources
4. **Shows accurate statistics** for what data is available

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**: Consider implementing provider-specific integrations using their official APIs
2. **For AWS**: Use AWS Health API with proper authentication
3. **For Azure**: Monitor the web interface or use Azure Monitor
4. **For OCI**: Use OCI Console or set up OCI Notifications
5. **For GCP**: Current RSS feed integration is sufficient

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **AWS Health API Integration**: Add support for authenticated AWS Health API access
2. **Azure Status API**: Implement Azure Status API integration
3. **JSON API Integration**: Prioritize JSON APIs over RSS feeds where available (like GCP)
4. **Web Scraping**: Add web scraping capabilities for providers without RSS feeds
5. **Notification Integration**: Add support for provider-specific notification systems
6. **Historical Data Archiving**: Implement local storage of incident data for historical analysis
