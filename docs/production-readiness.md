## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

#### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Primary indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_tenant_timestamp 
ON audit_logs (tenant_id, timestamp DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_user_timestamp 
ON audit_logs (user_id, timestamp DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_event_type 
ON audit_logs (event_type, timestamp DESC);

-- Composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_tenant_event_timestamp 
ON audit_logs (tenant_id, event_type, timestamp DESC);
```

#### Query Optimization
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for slow queries
- Implement query result caching
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations

### Caching Strategy

#### Redis Configuration
```yaml
Cache Layers:
